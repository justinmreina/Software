on bash_profile, if a file exists, then print, and delete that file on completion

//next steps
	get the cygwin_git.bat tied into a new right-click menu action
	when that is called, ensure it generates the new file, cygwin sees it and acts appropriately

e.g.

justin.bat
	creates a shell file for cygwin to run (C:\sw\cygwin64\jmr\cyg_boot.sh)
	calls mintty.exe
		mintty in bash_profile checks for this file. if found, it does the git op, then deletes the file
		
	or
	
	creates an empty file to signal cygwin (C:\sw\cygwin64\jmr\use_git_jmr)
		>echo test > C:\sw\cygwin64\jmr\use_git_jmr
	calls mintty.exe
		mintty in bash_profile checks for this file. 
		if found
			does the git op
			then deletes the file
		else
			just normal op!

			
//.bash_profile addition
	#Jmr Add
	USERNAME="\e[0;32mJustin@DESKTOP-N8UIS43\e[0m"
	DIRECTORY="$(pwd)"

	#Check for jmr-git-flag file
	if [ -f  /cygdrive/c/sw/cygwin64/jmr/use_git_jmr ]
	then
		#print the normal cygwin terminal line <open>
		
		#check the git status
		git status
		
		#remove the file on completion. note that it must have full permissions in cygwin 
		#else it will ask the user for confirmation to delete
		rm /cygdrive/c/sw/cygwin64/jmr/use_git_jmr
	fi

	how do you pass input arguments to a Windows Bat file?
		*specifically the working directory of the call

@open
	how do you pass input arguments to Cygwin?
		*shared file access
